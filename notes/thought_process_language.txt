Base the language on Antlr.

What version of Antlr to use?  Maybe 3 since modification of the document tree will be needed.

Initial example:  Given a distance to a goal from a starting point, traverse in the opposite direction the same distance diff the current target attribute value with the past value, and forcast a linear relationship.

initial pseudocode:
forcastValue = (2 * Node($startNode).getNumberAttr($targetAttr)) - (traverse($startNode, $relname, $direction, $distance).getNumberAttr($targetAttr))
